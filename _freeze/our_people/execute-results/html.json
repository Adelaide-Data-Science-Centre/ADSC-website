We use experimental methods and modelling of cognitive processes to understand and improve human decision-making in important contexts, such as health, policing and national security. ACEP is working to improve the decisions of people in areas of law, including police, eyewitnesses and jurors. In doing so, we hope to improve the use of technology in legal systems and limit any harm derived from misapplication. We are also active in areas of health and defence, where our focus is on methods to improve the decisions of health consumers, doctors and intelligence analysts.\n\n\n#### Charles Caraguel  \n**Associate Professor/Reader**  \nEmail: [charles.caraguel@adelaide.edu.au](mailto:charles.caraguel@adelaide.edu.au)  \nWebsite: [https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/charles.caraguel](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/charles.caraguel)  \nMy goal is to improve understanding, establish evidence, and develop more effective health risk identification and management in the aquaculture industry using epidemiology of infectious and non-infectious diseases. Epidemiology (field-based) research activity is also required to assess the applicability and validate in real field settings the outcomes from disease intervention studies (lab-based ). The complex interaction between disorder characteristics, host species responses and environmental factors directly impacts the effectiveness of intervention and management for aquatics. Field-based comprehension of health disorders is critical to the decision making process based on evidence and contributes to the implantation health policies in aquatic animal health by government and industry.\n\n\n#### David Huang  \n**Associate Professor**  \nEmail: [david.huang@adelaide.edu.au](mailto:david.huang@adelaide.edu.au)  \nWebsite: [https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/david.huang](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/david.huang)  \nPersonal Website: [https://huang-lab.org/ (Research Group)](https://huang-lab.org/ (Research Group))  \nI use theory and computation to study condensed phase phenomena in chemistry and materials science on the molecular and nano scales.

Past projects include: large-eddy simulation of Rayleigh-Taylor instability, homogeneous turbulence, mixing layers and jets in cross flow; simulations of bushfires and their interaction with the atmosphere; blood flow through the umbilical cord; transient flows around rotating annular ducts and spheres; and swirling flow through pipes and past spheres.\n\n\n#### Jordan Pitt  \n**ARC Grant-Funded Researcher (A)**  \nEmail: [jordan.pitt@adelaide.edu.au](mailto:jordan.pitt@adelaide.edu.au)  \nWebsite: [https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/jordan.pitt](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/jordan.pitt)  \nMy PhD at the Australian National university under Stephen Roberts and Christopher Zoppou was on developing robust, efficient and well validated numerical methods to model dispersive wave equations. In particular hybrid Finite Element Methods and Finite Volume Methods to solve the Serre equations. My current Post-Doc research under Luke Bennets at the University of Adelaide is on understanding the interaction between ocean waves and sea ice.\n\n\n#### Michael Chen  \n**Senior Lecturer**  \nEmail: [michael.chen@adelaide.edu.au](mailto:michael.chen@adelaide.edu.au)  \nWebsite: [https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/michael.chen](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/michael.chen)  \n\n\n#### Chantelle Blachut  \n**ARC Grant-Fund Researcher (A)**  \nEmail: [chantelle.blachut@adelaide.edu.au](mailto:chantelle.blachut@adelaide.edu.au)  \nWebsite: [https://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/chantelle.blachut](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/directory/chantelle.blachut)  \n\n\n## Students\n\nTBD\n",
