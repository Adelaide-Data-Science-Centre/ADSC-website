My goal is to improve understanding, establish evidence, and develop more effective health risk identification and management in the aquaculture industry using epidemiology of infectious and non-infectious diseases. Epidemiology (field-based) research activity is also required to assess the applicability and validate in real field settings the outcomes from disease intervention studies (lab-based ). The complex interaction between disorder characteristics, host species responses and environmental factors directly impacts the effectiveness of intervention and management for aquatics. Field-based comprehension of health disorders is critical to the decision making process based on evidence and contributes to the implantation health policies in aquatic animal health by government and industry.
