My main research interest is in evidence based decision making for natural resources management. Clearly, decision making related to environmental issues is always spatial decision making and all environmental decision support systems are also spatial decision support systems. I specialise in GIS, spatial simulation modelling, and spatial decision support. My research relates do understanding causes of spatial heterogeneity of the environment at different spatial and temporal scales and how we can use this knowledge to increase both economic production and the integrity of our environment (i.e.&nbsp;biodiversity, wildlife conservation, landscape capability, soil integrity, surface and ground water quality).</p>

I lead the Applied Cognition and Experimental Psychology (ACEP) research group, focusing on the application of theories and models of cognition, judgement and decision-making to legal and medical contexts. We are interested in understanding human interaction with intelligent agents and the development of human-machine interfaces for defence and national security. We use experimental methods and modelling of cognitive processes to understand and improve human decision-making in important contexts, such as health, policing and national security. ACEP is working to improve the decisions of people in areas of law, including police, eyewitnesses and jurors. In doing so, we hope to improve the use of technology in legal systems and limit any harm derived from misapplication. We are also active in areas of health and defence, where our focus is on methods to improve the decisions of health consumers, doctors and intelligence analysts.</p>

My goal is to improve understanding, establish evidence, and develop more effective health risk identification and management in the aquaculture industry using epidemiology of infectious and non-infectious diseases. Epidemiology (field-based) research activity is also required to assess the applicability and validate in real field settings the outcomes from disease intervention studies (lab-based ). The complex interaction between disorder characteristics, host species responses and environmental factors directly impacts the effectiveness of intervention and management for aquatics. Field-based comprehension of health disorders is critical to the decision making process based on evidence and contributes to the implantation health policies in aquatic animal health by government and industry.</p>

I have over 25 years of experience using MT. My group has run the national AuScope MT facility for the last ten years, and is involved in a wide range of research activities, including the national MT mapping program AusLAMP, and 4D monitoring of fluids for hydrocarbon and geothermal energy development. We were finalists for the Eureka awards (in the category Land and Water) and were recent winners (November 2013) of the Australian Innovation Challenge (in the category Minerals and Energy). In 2016, I started the National Exploration Undercover School (NExUS www.nexus.org.au). This is a national three-week summer school in South Australia for 30 of the best new students developing careers in the minerals industry.</p>

I have over 25 years experience as a leading mathematics educator and researcher, at universities across four continents. I am interested in problems which lie at overlaps of pure mathematics, applied mathematics, statistics, data, and applications. As an applied analyst and mathematical modeller, I have developed methods for, and used methods in, disparate areas such as dynamical systems; geophysical and microfluidic fluid mechanics; ecology; data-driven modelling; optimization; stochastic modelling and simulation; control theory; cell and tumour growth modelling; functional analysis; combustion; biostatistics; ordinary, partial and stochastic differential equations; computational methods; and uncertainty quantification.</p>

Shortly after completing my PhD I accepted a Research Associate position at the University of Adelaide, researching the chaotic dynamical systems approach to fluid mixing and its application to designing mixing devices. I briefly left Adelaide in 2007, joining the University of Melbourne as a Research Fellow. There I developed both discrete and continuous mathematical models for the neural crest cell invasion in the embryonic gut. I returned to the University of Adelaide in 2009, having been appointed a continuing position as a Lecturer in Applied Mathematics. My current research includes (i) quantifying and modelling biological spatial patterns and (ii) predicting channel bed topography in free-surface flows.</p>

I have been a Professor in the School of Mathematical Sciences since January 2018. I enjoy using mathematics to solve real-world problems in fluid mechanics, industry and in biology, and believe it is important to impart the skills needed for this to the next generations. I seek to encourage female students to consider STEM careers and to promote the value of mathematics in the wider community. I undertake research in the field of theoretical fluid mechanics, in particular viscous flows involving free and moving boundaries. Current projects include the modelling of optical fibre fabrication, and thin-film flow in curved channels and ducts. In addition I have research interests in mathematical biology, modelling nutrient transport and chemical signalling in tissue.</p>
